### Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


### Please note that the following data set is from the US in the 20th century.
### Gender proportions for occupations and ages are thus reflective of that era.
### Import the dataset from this address.
### https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/DAT8/master/data/u.user
### Assign it to a variable called users and use the 'user_id' as index
users = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/DAT8/master/data/u.user', 
                      sep='|', index_col='user_id')


# Problem 1. Print the data frame. By default,
# Pandas prints the first few rows and the last few rows.
# This exercise has already been done for you
users


# Problem 2. How many observations and columns are in the data?
# Run the necessary command that will output the answer.

# Problem 3. How many different occupations there are in this dataset?
